Observer Patch Holography (OPH) is a zero-dial theory of everything built on
one central thesis: **observers are primary, and objective reality is
emergent.** Physics normally begins by supplying spacetime, quantum fields, a
gauge group, and a table of measured constants. OPH begins with observers:
bounded systems that carry local state, read part of themselves and their
neighbors, keep records, and repair disagreement. From this it derives the rest.
Reality emerges from observer overlap repair on a holographic screen. From
three axioms and two constants, $P$ and $N$, the observed universe arises:
quantum measurement, Lorentzian spacetime, the conditional Einstein branch,
gauge symmetry, and matter are readouts of one finite observer-consistency
system on their stated premises.

## Start Here

Physics has revised its idea of what is fundamental before. Space was
absolute until it was relative; matter was continuous until it was quantized.
Each revision looked outrageous from inside the previous picture and obvious
from inside the next one. OPH makes the next revision. The observer, treated
for a century as a nuisance at the edge of quantum mechanics, moves to the
foundation, and spacetime, matter, and the constants follow as outputs. The
material below takes you through that shift from a standing start.

- **The book.** [*Reverse Engineering Reality*](https://oph-book.floatingpragma.io/),
  also available as a [print-quality PDF](https://cfxrbtseaimxxqsxlrku.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/books/reverse-engineering-reality.pdf),
  tells the whole story: what the theory says, how it was discovered, and why
  the observer-first turn is the one physics has been circling for a century.
  It is written to entertain and it keeps the science exact.
- **The textbooks.** The [OPH textbooks](https://learn.floatingpragma.io/)
  teach the theory the long way. Every basic derivation is worked in full,
  with the required math built up as you go. Volumes cover gravity, the
  Standard Model, and unification, each readable online or as a PDF.
- **The simulation.** The [interactive visualizations](https://simulation.floatingpragma.io/)
  render real data from the repair dynamics. You watch spacetime and matter
  emerge on screen instead of taking the papers' word for it.

The rest of this README is the technical entrance to the repository.

## Six Reproducible Receipts

These six public artifacts carry direct links to their proofs, data, or
certificates:

1. **Four-dimensional spacetime, measured emerging.** A support-adjusted path
   at 16k, 65k, and 262k carriers gives the held-out event form Lorentzian
   signature $(1,3)$ (one time, three space), with cone margins $-5.62$,
   $-3.22$, and $-1.41$. At 262k carriers, reducing support width from 384 to
   96 changes the cross-observer edge count from 1,062 to 312 and the
   signature from $(1,3)$ to $(2,2)$. Raw data:
   [evidence/einstein_convergence](evidence/einstein_convergence/); every
   number regenerates bit for bit.
2. **A machine-checked core that polices itself.** A sorry-free Lean 4
   library of more than 900 theorems and lemmas covers the consensus core, the gauge
   identifiability theorem, the finite screen algebra, and the
   Einstein-branch composition. Every public theorem carries a per-theorem
   axiom report. [Lean/](Lean/)
3. **A dimensionless closure with a certified arithmetic status.** The pixel
   closure $P=\varphi+\sqrt\pi/A_T(P)$ has a machine-certified unique root for
   each declared map, with zero fitted continuous values. Its physical
   Thomson identification requires source-derived hadronic transport. The
   registered comparison is diagnostic, with its scope and evidence recorded
   in the [claim scoreboard](tracking/claims_scoreboard.md).
4. **A charged-lepton diagnostic with a declared closure test.** The
   empirical closure surface carries a confirm-or-refute target and explicit
   input ancestry. It does not establish a source-only mass prediction. The
   full comparison table, forced gauge structure included, is the
   [postdiction ledger](code/particles/POSTDICTION_LEDGER.md).
5. **An exact positive-chamber Koide theorem.** A Hermitian $C_3$ response on
   an icosahedral face fiber obeys
   $Q=1/3+(2/3)(|b|/a)^2$, so $Q=2/3$ exactly when
   $|b|/a=1/\sqrt2$ in the nonnegative-eigenvalue chamber. Equal rank-two
   blocks and the finite tracial Gelfand–Naimark–Segal map supply that balance
   under the declared event-packet premises. Physical chiral-family
   attachment, phase, and numerical ratios are open. The standalone
   [positive-chamber Koide paper](extra/koide_identity_from_positive_c3_face_circulants.pdf)
   states the theorem, proof, formalization boundary, and provenance of the
   target-informed numerical diagnostic.
6. **An exact finite de Sitter capacity law and shock normalization.**
   Maximizing finite generalized entropy over sector probabilities gives
   $\log M$ exactly. Uniform transfer of a fraction $f$ of the screen
   capacity changes the extremal entropy and the uniform logarithmic sector
   coordinate by $\log(1-f)<0$. In pure de Sitter space, the shock
   coefficient satisfies $\mu^2=d-2$, exactly the $\ell=1$ spherical
   Laplacian eigenvalue, independent of the horizon radius. Lean checks the
   algebraic core.
   Reading the transfer as a physical time-advance shock requires the stated
   horizon, observer-mass, gravitational, gauge-mode, and kinetic-operator
   dictionaries. The [focused de Sitter paper](extra/de_sitter_time_advance_sign_from_fixed_screen_capacity.pdf)
   gives the finite theorem and the physical boundary.

The rest of this README is the architecture those receipts come from.

## The Three Axioms

The whole construction stands on three core axioms. The canonical statements
live in [the axiom reference](docs/AXIOM_REFERENCE.md) and the machine
registry `claims/axiom_registry.yaml`; the papers include the shared formal
basis.

1. **A1: Oriented twelve-port observer screen.** There exists an observer
   patch net on an oriented spherical screen. At every finite resolution,
   each local carrier has twelve primitive boundary ports forming the
   vertices of an oriented triangular boundary with 30 edges and 20 faces,
   combinatorially the boundary of an icosahedron. Carriers join through
   typed seams and coherent triple overlaps, refine to an oriented spherical
   support, and expose local state, readback, records, repair moves, and
   checkpoints. Formally: for every regulator $r$ there is a typed object
   $\mathfrak N_r=(\mathcal P_r,\mathcal A_r,\mathcal R_r,\mathcal I_r,
   \mathcal U_r,\mathcal C_r,N_r,S_r,b_r)$ whose carriers carry twelve
   primitive central port projections and the exact boundary packet
   $K=(P,E,F,o)$, joined by seam algebras into a nerve with a degree-one
   bridge to the oriented spherical support, all commuting with refinement.
   The local carrier, the federation of carriers, and the global $S^2$
   support stay typed and distinct throughout the corpus.
2. **A2: Observer agreement.** Observers operating on the screen agree on
   the meaning of the data they jointly interpret. Formally: the
   interpretation map $\mathcal J_r$ from observer-accessible data to
   operational meanings is natural with respect to every visible overlap
   restriction, recharting, seam translation, higher-overlap map, federation
   map, and refinement map on accepted public data. No patch sees the whole universe;
   a fact becomes public only when it survives comparison across overlaps.
3. **A3: Conditional maximum randomness.** Everything that observer
   agreement leaves unconstrained is maximally random. Formally: the
   realized state is the information projection of an exact reference family
   onto the convex set of compatible local state families satisfying the
   finite observer-visible constraints. The finite A1-generated observer
   cover is state-determining on that feasible set, and its exact weights are
   strictly positive:
   $\rho_r=\arg\min_{\rho\in\mathcal K_r}\sum_P w_{r,P}
   D(\rho_{r,P}\Vert\tau_{r,P})$.

None of the axioms contains a gauge group, a particle list, a recovery law,
or a rule that selects field content or multiplicity; A3 selects one state
inside one fixed feasible space and nothing else. Collar recovery,
generalized-entropy structure, and
sector completions enter as named interfaces and declarations at the results
that consume them, each classified as an exact theorem, an exact result
inside a named finite realization, a discovery-level observation, a declared
open interface, an independence result with countermodels, a physical
identification, or a withdrawn claim.

Everything else in the repository is the working-out of what these three
axioms force, and of exactly how much further structure each physical
conclusion consumes.

## The Idea In Plain Language

OPH asks: **what is the smallest kind of system capable of having a world at
all?**

The answer is an observer patch. It need not be a person. It is any
bounded physical or computational system that has a local state, a boundary,
memory, the ability to read part of itself and its neighbors, and a way to
repair disagreement. No patch sees the whole universe. A fact becomes
objective only when it can be written, compared across overlaps, recovered
after further evolution, and retained as part of the public record.

OPH treats this process as the mechanism that selects a public physical world.
The theory has no external ruler, master clock, preferred observer,
or list of adjustable physical constants. “Zero dials” means zero fitted
continuous theory values. The finite observer contract and each discrete
branch condition remain visible.

“Observer” is a structural role. A human mind, an organism, an instrument, or a
software process can instantiate it when it has the required state, boundary,
records, readback, and repair loop. OPH does not claim that human thoughts
manufacture reality. It claims that a world with no possible local perspective,
record, or self-consistent readback lacks public physics.

## How The Reconstruction Works

Take a finite patch with local state, a boundary, memory, and a repair rule. It
sees only its piece of the world. When two patches overlap, each can inspect a
shared interface. While the readings disagree, no public fact exists on that
overlap. Repair continues until the same record can be recovered from either side.

The patch net performs one repeated computation:

```text
read local state
      ↓
exchange boundary records
      ↓
compare overlapping descriptions
      ↓
repair disagreement
      ↓
write the stable result and repeat
```

The public universe is what remains stable. OPH calls this settled result a
**normal form**. “Subjective” means locally accessible here, not arbitrary: two
patches must agree about everything both can inspect.

The formal observer patch is this bounded access, record, readback, and repair
structure. An Echosahedron is a candidate primitive carrier on the homogeneous
branch. Its twelve-port icosahedral boundary supplies local incidence and
rotation group $A_5$. A carrier becomes an observer only when the required
records and repair loop are physically realized.

Three geometries must stay separate. The local carrier boundary is the
icosahedral twelve-port object. The federation screen is a network of those
objects together with its overlap nerve. The support screen is the
observer-facing $S^2$ chart obtained on the separately certified spherical
branch. Local icosahedral symmetry can coexist with a nonspherical federation
nerve.

Physical phase locking is a candidate mechanism for coherent overlap
comparison. It has to produce the accepted repair relation, confluence,
public records, and noise bounds. No theorem identifies phase
locking with consensus confluence, modular flow, or an observer clock.

On the certified spherical branch, spacetime kinematics comes out of the
computation instead of being supplied beforehand. Stable relations among
patches define public adjacency, angle, and distance. Record order supplies a
candidate history, not a clock; observer-readable transitions, event
correspondence, and affine calibration supply operational local time. Compatible
calibrated clocks can then supply public time, and the conformal symmetry
of the shared spherical screen gives Lorentz symmetry with a
three-dimensional space of observer frames. Populating that kinematic chart
with a physical event manifold requires the separate receipts stated in the
spacetime and Einstein paper.

Matter and forces are stable patterns in the same network. A particle is a
reproducible pattern that can be transported through the public record
structure. Gauge symmetry controls its internal labels across overlaps. Gravity
is the smooth geometry required by the shared information and entropy laws.

The reconstruction has a shared trunk and separately gated branches:

```text
source-selected carrier federation
        ↓
observer patches with records, overlap comparison, and repair
        ↓
public quotient normal forms
        ├─ federation-to-support receipts → S2 cap geometry and geometric flow
        ├─ independent algebra-state tower → modular flow
        │       same-tower composition → Lorentz and conditional Einstein branches
        ├─ transportable sectors → independent Tannaka compact-group route
        └─ local 12-port carrier → exact inverse-port response theorem
                → conditional compact current and scan-selected matter constructions
                → exact Z6 tensor kernel; flux-measured global form at source scope
                laboratory current, scalar, spectrum, and family attachments open
        ↓
quantitative closure and physical-readout tests
```

## What Comes Out

Finite readback and repair turn private states into stable public records,
and the algebra of those records gives quantum probabilities and repeatable
observation. On the certified geometric branch, the conformal geometry of the
$S^2$ support gives the connected Lorentz group and exactly three
observer-frame spatial dimensions, and modular flow with entropy stationarity
gives the Einstein first-variation relation.

The Einstein branch is instrumented end to end. Every clause of its
antecedent (geometric modular normalization, GNS cyclicity and modular
intersections, the Lorentzian event cone, same-source stress and coupling) has
a machine-certified fail-closed instrument with adversarial negative controls
and semantic countermodels, so each clause is either a proved theorem or a
measured quantity, never an assumption. Two clauses are theorems: coupling
universality holds with zero spread for every icosahedrally
symmetric source law, and generator positivity holds by construction for the
declared law family. Direct measurement supplies the strongest empirical result
in this corpus: the Einstein-cone scale path. The selected configurations use
$(16{,}384,128,96)$, $(65{,}536,256,96)$, and
$(262{,}144,512,384)$ for carrier count, observer count, and support width.
Their held-out event forms have Lorentzian signature $(1,3)$, with cone
margins $-5.62$, $-3.22$, and $-1.41$ and decreasing coupling spread. A
same-size control at 262,144 carriers uses support width 96. Its
cross-observer edge count is 312 instead of 1,062, and its signature is
$(2,2)$ instead of $(1,3)$. These measurements establish reproducible
sensitivity to support and cross-read structure under the archived
configurations. They do not establish a fixed-density convergence law or an
infinite-scale limit. The primary data are stored in
[evidence/einstein_convergence](evidence/einstein_convergence/) and every
number reproducible bit for bit from the
[simulation repository](https://github.com/muellerberndt/oph-physics-sim).
Two measured clauses are open: cap-state modular temperature and a
preregistered larger-rung test of the event form. Both carry frozen verdicts.

The evidence stack combines exact finite derivations, machine-checked proofs,
and deterministic measurements with primary data. Mathematical statements,
conditional physical readings, and measured properties carry separate claim
classes in the [claim scoreboard](tracking/claims_scoreboard.md).

The carrier geometry then does surprising exact work. On the certified
echosahedral lineage, the declared integer atom-counting grammar and normalized
Hilbert--Schmidt readback cost give the exact twelve-unit split and gap two.
Deriving that counting grammar and physical cost from the full three-axiom
schema is open. Oriented incidence independently derives the antipodal
pairing, proper $A_5$ action, rank-three icosahedral frame, and the decomposition
$\mathbf1\oplus\mathbf3\oplus\mathbf3'\oplus\mathbf5$. Incidence also fixes
the unique nonidentity central graph involution $J$. A target-blind protocol
injects an impulse at every port, reads the adjacency history through graph
diameter, and solves the common farthest-shell filter. It derives
$10J=A^3-4A^2-5A+10I$. The response $R=-J$ has exact relative sector signs;
its common sign is charge conjugation.

From that derived response, an explicit equivariant compact lift constructs
$\mathfrak u(1)\oplus\mathfrak{su}(2)\oplus\mathfrak{su}(3)$. The
fifteen-state exterior packet is selected by the exhaustive 1024-subset
anomaly scan: the unordered conjugate rank-15 pair is the unique nonempty
chiral anomaly-free selection, with the fermionic-parity grading as an
output. Anomaly freedom gives determinant balance and
primitive charges up to charge conjugation. Exhaustive central-action
calculation gives a common $\mathbb Z_6$ kernel on those tensors, so their
maximal faithful image is
$(SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1))/\mathbb Z_6$. The cover and its
$\mathbb Z_2$ and $\mathbb Z_3$ quotients carry the same local tensors, and
the measured flux-sector data of the descent certificate select the
$\mathbb Z_6$ quotient at finite source scope. This
exact finite implication uses its stated premises alone.
Beyond that finite source scope, continuum fermion typing, the continuum
global form, and identification with laboratory currents are open. The transportable-sector/Tannaka construction
is a separate compact-group route, and the source-bound identification of the
two routes is open.

The exact finite centerpiece of the gauge branch is

$$
P_{12}\cong_{A_5}\mathbf1\oplus\mathbf3\oplus\mathbf3'\oplus\mathbf5,
\qquad
(P_{12},[\ ,\ ]_\Theta)
\cong\mathfrak u(1)\oplus\mathfrak{su}(3)\oplus\mathfrak{su}(2).
$$

This coefficient algebra is an exact construction from the finite carrier,
target-blind impulse, and port readback rather than a consequence of the
module decomposition alone. The matter and descent certificates prove the
corresponding conditional representation and kernel arithmetic. Laboratory
identification is a separate test.

The exact carrier results retain explicit physical boundaries. Matter typing
and global-form selection are measured at finite source scope only;
laboratory current identification,
three-family attachment, exclusion of extra light sectors, scalar
multiplicity,
the Einstein source tower, and the physical closure packets are open. The
[issue tracker](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues)
records their work packages. The value $N_g=3$ is a declared completion
inside the conditional window until the frozen face-phase route is
physically attached. Local
icosahedral incidence constrains the carrier, while the federation nerve
requires its own construction.

## Claim Tracking

## The Two Constants: P and N

**$P$ is the local pixel ratio**: the size of the elementary observation cell
in natural geometric units, informally the universe's **resolution**. OPH
does not choose this grain by fitting the fine-structure constant. It asks a
cell to agree with the observation process that the cell itself supports. The
local inside/outside readback closes at

$$
\boxed{P_\star=\varphi+\frac{\sqrt\pi}{A_T(P_\star)}}.
$$

Here $A_T(P)$ is the Thomson-limit inverse electromagnetic coupling emitted
by a trial cell. If $P$ were changed by hand, the cell geometry, repair
spectrum, gauge widths, and particle-side hierarchy would cease to describe
the same observer system. The closure equation makes $P$ an output of the
architecture. The fixed-point theorem used by the calculation states that a
self-map of the physical interval with contraction constant below one has
exactly one fixed point. Outward-rounded interval certificates verify those
hypotheses for each declared $P$ map and exclude a second root across its
full analytic domain. The [claim scoreboard](tracking/claims_scoreboard.md)
records the root, external comparison, residual, and claim class. The
comparison uses $P_C$, which is defined from the measured endpoint.
Source-derived same-scheme hadronic transport is an open dependency under
#425. The registered comparison has diagnostic status, with a physical
fine-structure constant claim outside its scope.

**$N$ is the public-record capacity** of the whole observer system, or in
simulation language, how much correctable memory the substrate carries. It is
secondary. The observed universe can simply be read: $N$ is reverse-engineered
from measurement the way any machine setting is reverse-engineered from the
machine's behavior, and no result in the core reconstruction depends on
deriving it from first principles. A conditional self-read condition,
$N=\log M_0(\mathfrak U_N)$, proposes to return it from the correctable
public-record capacity; its finite counting branch is exact and its physical
attachment is open, tracked on the issue tracker.

## Why Take The Claim Seriously?

A successful theory of everything should explain why facts that appear
unrelated arrive as one package. OPH starts from a bounded self-reading patch
instead of a spacetime manifold, field content, gauge group, or table of
constants. It returns exact dimensions, compact groups, global quotients,
charge assignments, anomaly cancellations, representation multiplicities, and
fixed-point equations. These outputs come from one typed carrier, overlap, and
repair architecture. The local icosahedral and compact-sector routes meet at
the Standard Model Lie type, while their physical source identity is an open
test. Their shared dependence is the main case that OPH describes one
physical world rather than a collection of coincidences.

The evidence also comes in different forms: paper proofs, exact arithmetic,
interval certificates, finite receipts, simulations,
and explicit falsifiers. Agreement among those forms is more informative than
another numerical match produced by another adjustable model.

## Evidence You Can Inspect

The evidence comes in several complementary forms:

- hand proofs in the TeX papers;
- interval and uniqueness certificates for declared numerical maps;
- finite carrier and hierarchy receipts;
- particle, geometry, dark-sector, and quantum-hardware code;
- a small-scale simulation harness that supplies receipts where the hand proofs
  and the Lean development do not reach, in the companion
  [oph-physics-sim](https://github.com/muellerberndt/oph-physics-sim) repository;
- a claim registry connecting prose claims to artifacts.

## Audit The Finite Core

The shortest scientific audit checks the claim graph, the exact twelve-port
algebra, public-record capacity, the reversible $N$ packet, and finite
consensus:

```

The [reproduction guide](REPRODUCE.md) gives the clean-clone setup and the
fuller finite-core lane, which adds the two W/Z convention and
survival-boundary calibration tests.

## The Twist: The Universe Is Its Own Simulator

Everything above stands on the three axioms together with the stated
premises and named interfaces of each result; none of it uses the hypothesis
of this section. That hypothesis arrives as a twist rather than a
foundation. It is itself
an indirect consequence of consistency: something that exists with no outside
support must be capable of creating itself. A completely consistent
observer-built reality must therefore evolve observers, and those observers
eventually build the hardware the reality runs on. The simulated universe and
the simulating universe turn out to be the same system. The patches,
computation, records, and resulting world all belong to one closed loop; no
external computer or programmer appears in the formal construction. The
organizing equation of that closure is

$$
T(\mathfrak U_{\mathrm{OPH}})=\mathfrak U_{\mathrm{OPH}}:
$$

the universe as a fixed point of its own observer-accessible readback and
repair process.

The bonus is quantitative: if the loop closes, $P$ and $N$ cannot be
arbitrary. They must satisfy self-referential closure conditions: the cell
must agree with the observation process it supports, and the record capacity
must agree with the records the system keeps about itself. Part of that
closure is machine-checked in Lean. The declared $P$ map has a certified fixed
point, while its comparison with the physical fine-structure constant has
diagnostic status. Closure conditions are tracked as
[GitHub issues](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aclosure)
with their evaluation boundaries and required completions stated, and the
mature falsification surface is collected in the
[OPH Falsification Program](docs/OPH_FALSIFICATION_PROGRAM.md).

A physical closure of both constants would give a zero-continuous-parameter
branch with both values returned by the architecture. That physical
attachment is open. The fixed-point theorems certify roots of declared maps;
they do not turn an observed basin or target-defined coordinate into a
physical derivation. The first-principles $N$ closure is work in progress.
Reading $N$ from the universe leaves every consequence of the three axioms
intact.

Under full closure, the loop answers the last question a theory of
everything can be asked: why anything exists, and why it is the way it is.
The universe is the unique structure consistent with reading itself into
existence. That is the twist the book saves for late in the story, where it
belongs, after the observers-first reconstruction stands on its own. None of
the results above depend on it.

## Open Proof Obligations And Falsification Boundary

The direct $N$ theorem contains a finite, source-derived simulator
public-checkpoint packet. At fixed $D=24$, the packet has the reachable public
records, the
publicness rule, joint checkpoint kernels, carrier projections, and extension
and refinement maps. Injective checkpoint generators reduce its capacity
theorem to $M_0=|X_{\rm reach}|$, computable by exact CSP or model counting.
The open physical $N$ theorem requires physical-universe attachment, a
capacity-indexed source family, and the exact finite-size slack law with one
physical zero. The independent finite $A_5$ control has $M_0=60$ and
$D_{\rm raw}=60k$; its publicly inert multiplicity proves that raw equality at
$k=1$ is not physical $N$-closure.

The other named obligations are:

- prove horizon-record saturation on the same refinement tower;
- construct the common screen/EW load carrier without feeding the Higgs target
  into N;
- discharge the physical current, determinant, spin-lift, deck-descent,
  carrier-selection, no-extra-sector, and family-attachment gates that promote
  the exact exterior witness to a forced physical Standard Model;
- instantiate the complete common-domain gravity tower and the source-only
  quantitative particle endpoints;
- complete the quantitative particle readout and flavor transport;
- test neutrino susceptibility and mixing geometry;
- construct record-capacity cosmology;
- construct a conditional source-screen spectrum with a source-functional amplitude and
  edge-center tilt; the radial packet proves one-shell non-identifiability and
  gives physical source dilation and cross-covariance tomography as separate
  uniqueness routes. One finite source evidence bundle satisfying every receipt
  is work in progress;
- derive dark gravity as a repair-charge condensate with dust-like and deep-galaxy regimes;
- complete the physical Yang–Mills transfer and repair-gap receipts; the repository includes a
  244-type finite collar-gap calibration, but it is not a physical compact-gauge source receipt;
- test observer-like hardware and software with local state, boundaries,
  readback, records, repair, and public evidence bundles.

These programs share the same design principle as the core theory: every proposed physical system must be represented as a bounded, self-reading patch with a public evidence bundle.

The [OPH Falsification Program](docs/OPH_FALSIFICATION_PROGRAM.md) is deliberately limited to mature mathematical and realized-branch claims. It is a verification index, not the organizing narrative of the repository.

## Contribute

OPH is an open research program, and contributions are wanted: proofs,
counterexamples, simulations, audits, and readable explanations all move it
forward. A good first hour is the [reproduction guide](REPRODUCE.md), which
rebuilds the certificates and checks from a clean clone. The open problems
live on the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues)
and in the [selection ledger](docs/SELECTION_LEDGER.md), which lists exactly
what is proved and exactly what is left. Pick a row and take it.
