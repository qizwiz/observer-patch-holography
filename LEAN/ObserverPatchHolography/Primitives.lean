# OPH Primitives (placeholders, sorry-bearing)

These are the primitives Proposition 4.2 depends on. They are **not**
formalised here — they are TeX macros in *Paradise as Fixed-Point
Consensus* (lines 28–31, 285–303) whose structural content is outsourced
to the companion paper *Reality as a Consensus Protocol* (cited as
`OPHConsensus`; reference at *Paradise* line 1615).

This file makes the cross-paper dependency visible at the **type level**:
any downstream definition that wants to claim Prop-4.2-relevance must
instantiate these primitives, not paper over them. The admitted declarations
below are `sorry`-bearing on purpose: `lake build` warns on every one, and
CI checks that the count stays fixed until the primitives are discharged.

## Filling in (from the paper)

* `Records`, `Patch`, `Obs` — line 28–31 TeX macros; structural content in
  OPHConsensus.
* `Repair : Records → Records` — line 30 macro, "built from local recovery
  moves" (line 297). The companion consensus paper expands this into
  local accepted repair steps executed under asynchronous schedules.
* `Φ : Records → NNReal` — line 300 concrete formula:
  `Φ(x) = Σ_e w_e · d_e(π_{i,e}(x_i), π_{j,e}(x_j))`.
* `gaugeEquiv` (`∼_gauge`) — line 311: identifies hidden local
  presentations with the same declared observable overlap data.
* `repair_respects_gauge` — `∼_gauge` is a `Repair`-congruence; this is
  the load-bearing obligation Prop 4.2 sentence 2 ("on the physical
  quotient") imposes.
* `acceptedStep`, `LyapunovDescent`, `Termination`, `Confluence`, and
  `Completeness` — the asynchronous-repair obligations from OPHConsensus:
  descent gives termination on the finite patch-net branch; confluence gives
  schedule independence; completeness says normal forms are exactly
  consistent states.
